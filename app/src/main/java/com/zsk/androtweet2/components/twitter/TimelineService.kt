    /**
     * Returns a collection of the most recent tweets posted by the user indicated by the
     * screen_name or user_id parameters.
     *
     *
     * User timelines belonging to protected users may only be requested when the authenticated user
     * either "owns" the timeline or is an approved follower of the owner.
     *
     *
     * The timeline returned is the equivalent of the one seen when you view a user's profile on
     * twitter.com.
     *
     *
     * The Twitter REST API goes back up to 3,200 of a user's most recent tweets.
     * Native retweets of other statuses by the user is included in this total, regardless of
     * whether include_rts is set to false when requesting this resource.
     *
     *
     * Always specify either an user_id or screen_name when requesting a user timeline.
     *
     * @param userId (optional) The ID of the user for whom to return results for.
     * @param screenName (optional) The screen name of the user for whom to return results for.
     * @param count (optional) Specifies the number of tweets to try and retrieve, up to a maximum
     * of 200. The value of count is best thought of as a limit to the number of tweets
     * to return because suspended or deleted content is removed after the count has
     * been applied. We include retweets in the count, even if include_rts is not
     * supplied. It is recommended you always send include_rts=1 when using this API
     * method.
     * @param sinceId (optional) Returns results with an ID greater than (that is, more recent than)
     * the specified ID. There are limits to the number of tweets which can be
     * accessed through the API. If the limit of tweets has occurred since the
     * since_id, the since_id will be forced to the oldest ID available.
     * @param maxId (optional) Returns results with an ID less than (that is, older than) or equal
     * to the specified ID.
     * @param trimUser (optional) When set to either true, t or 1, each Tweet returned in a timeline
     * will include a user object including only the status authors numerical ID.
     * Omit this parameter to receive the complete user object.
     * @param excludeReplies (optional) This parameter will prevent replies from appearing in the
     * returned timeline. Using exclude_replies with the count parameter will
     * mean you will receive up-to count tweets â€” this is because the count
     * parameter retrieves that many tweets before filtering out retweets and
     * replies. This parameter is only supported for JSON and XML responses.
     * @param contributeDetails (optional) This parameter enhances the contributors element of the
     * status response to include the screen_name of the contributor. By
     * default only the user_id of the contributor is included.
     * @param includeRetweets (optional) When set to false, the timeline will strip any native
     * retweets (though they will still count toward both the maximal length
     * of the timeline and the slice selected by the count parameter).
     * Note: If you're using the trim_user parameter in conjunction with
     * include_rts, the retweets will still contain a full user object.
